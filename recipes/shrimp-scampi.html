        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil; cook linguine in boiling water until<br>
                nearly tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter with 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over<br>
                medium heat. Cook and stir shallots, garlic, and red pepper flakes in the hot<br>
                butter and oil until shallots are translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Season shrimp with<br>
                kosher salt and black pepper; add to the skillet and cook until pink, stirring<br>
                occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove shrimp from skillet and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Pour white wine and lemon juice into skillet and bring to a boil while scraping<br>
                the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon.<br>
                Melt 2 tablespoons butter in skillet, stir 2 tablespoons olive oil into butter<br>
                mixture, and bring to a simmer. Toss linguine, shrimp, and parsley in the butter<br>
                mixture until coated; season with salt and black pepper. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon<br>
                olive oil to serve.</li>
